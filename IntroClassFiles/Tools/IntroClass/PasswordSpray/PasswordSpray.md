# Password Spray

First things first, disable **Defender**. Open an instance of **Windows PowerShell** by clicking on the icon in the **desktop**. Then run the following:

```ps
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

This will disable **Defender** for this session.

If you get angry red errors, that is Ok, it means **Defender** is not running.

Let's get started by opening a **Command Prompt** terminal by clicking on the icon in the **desktop**.

Once the terminal opens, navigate into the appropriate directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd \IntroLabs
```

We need to run the batch file named **200-user-gen** 

Do so by typing the name of the batch file and hitting enter:

```bash
200-user-gen.bat
```

It should look like this:

Let this run all the way through. 

**Even though it looks endless, it's not!**

We will need to start **PowerShell** to run **"LocalPasswordSpray"**

Launch it by typing the following and hitting enter:

```bash
powershell
```

Run the following two commands:

```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

```ps
Import-Module .\LocalPasswordSpray.ps1
```

It should look like this:

Let’s try some password spraying against the local system!

```ps
Invoke-LocalPasswordSpray -Password Winter2025
```

It should look like this:

We need to clean up and make sure the system is ready for the rest of the labs.

Run the following two commands:

```ps
exit
```

```bash
user-remove.bat
```

Let this run all the way through. 

**Even though it looks endless, it's not!**
